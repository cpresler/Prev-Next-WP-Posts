---Prev/Next Links for Wordpress Archive and Single post pages ---

This is a code snippet that allows you to insert "Prev" and "Next" links into single post pages in WordPress.
It also inserts "Older Posts" and "Newer Posts" links in the same location on post list pages (aka: archive and index pages).

It is styled to be narrow because I wrote this for the sidebar of my blog, but it could easily be widened with a few changes 
to the CSS widths and used at the top or bottom of a post page.

To see an example of this in action check out my blog: http://www.christypresler.com/blog/
